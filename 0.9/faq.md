# FAQ

## What's the latest version of Sensu?

The latest version of Sensu is {{ site.current_version }}.

## How do Sensu clients handle network issues or RabbitMQ outages?

The Sensu client is able to handle network issues and RabbitMQ outages by attempting to reconnect to RabbitMQ on connection failure. The Sensu client immediately attempts to reconnect, if unsuccessful, it will make further attempts every 10 seconds, indefinitely.

## Do I need to synchronize my clocks?

Yes, as Sensu components use their local clocks for timestamps, they must be synchronized. Not synchronizing your clocks may result in client health false positives. Time synchronization can be done with NTP, see https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/NTP.html for more details. 

## How to delete a node (client) ?

When you retire a node from your infrastructure it may still show up in the sensu-dashboard as a "keepalive: no data from <host> in 300 seconds" alert.

There are two methods for deleting nodes: API, or through sensu-dashboard

Using the API:

```
curl -X DELETE http://<sensu-api>/client/<node>
```

Using the sensu-dashboard:

Click **Clients** > (click on a node) > **Remove**

## How do I increase log verbosity?

Toggle debug logging on/off by sending the process a `USR1` signal. Example:

```
shell$ ps aux | grep [s]ensu-server
sensu     5992  1.7  0.3 177232 24352 ...
shell$ kill -USR1 5992
```

## Any suggestions on naming conventions for metrics?

metrics-*name* seems to be the defacto convention right now

## Does Sensu require that Redis and RabbitMQ run locally?

No. Redis and RabbitMQ can run locally or on any remote host, so long as the server(s) and clients can communicate with them.

## Which components of a Sensu system need access to Redis?

Only the Sensu master server actively communicates with Redis. Any Sensu server which may become master will need access the Redis server in order to function as the master.

## Which components of a Sensu system need access to the RabbitMQ broker?

As Sensu depends on AMQP as its messaging bus, all server(s) and clients in a Sensu system require access to the RabbitMQ broker.

## When I have multiple Sensu-servers, which one will be the master?

First, it does not matter how many servers are running, and second they will automatically elect a master including a failover.

## How do I get the Sensu-server to create another client in client.json without manually doing it?

When a new client is joining, the server configuration does not have to be changed at all. That's one of the cool things about Sensu. The Sensu-client only needs to know the server and registers with it upon startup. In more detail, the server is creating channels in RabbitMQ and Sensu-clients are connecting to those channels. When a new instance with Sensu-client on it is being bootstrapped, and this client has a particular config which points to the server's RabbitMQ, there is no need to do anything manually on the server.

## Can someone show me an example of how they are listing multiple clients on the server?

See the answer in "How do I get the Sensu-server to create another client in client.json without manually doing it?". There is no need to manually list clients on the server. Each client has its own configuration, that only needs to point to the server. The server publishes checks and only learns about the client and only learns about clients as they report back with their check results and keepalives.

## I don't get how to register the xmpp handler, does it create an "xmpp" type, or should I call it with a "pipe" type ?

Call it with "pipe".

## Is there a configuration parameter to notify only every hour, even if the check has an interval of one minute?

In case your event-handler is using the "sensu-handler"-library you can add "refresh" to your check definition.

## In case of a network failure, does the sensu-client spool the metrics data and the check events, and send them after the network is back up?

...

## Is there another way then the "remove"-button in the web interface to remove clients and events from the dashboard, maybe some sort of "bulk-remove"?

...

## Do checks need to exist on the client?

No, the only need to be defined on the servers, but can defined on the client to override the check attributes from those that are being set on the server. Another case where a check needs to be present on the client is, when it is being defined as a standalone-check, then it does not be defined on the server. In "safe mode" the check also has to exist on both the client and the server.

## How do I configure a standalone-check?
Standalone-checks are configured like in http://blog.pkhamre.com/2012/03/21/sensu-standalone-checks/

## What is safe mode and how can I determine if it is enabled?

...

## According to  http://java.dzone.com/articles/getting-started-sensu, the conf.d/check_cron.json needs to exist on both, the server and the client, why?

It no longer needs to, that information is outdated.

## Can someone tell me exactly what silencing an event is supposed to do? Maybe I just incorrectly thought it prevented handlers from processing new occurrences of the event.

Handlers are always executed, and the handler is expected to check the /stashes under the sensu-api for silence entries.

Silencing an event involves it creating an entry under /stashes in the sensu-api. Handlers that inherit from   sensu::plugin::handlers (sensu-plugin gem) will properly check for stashes and exit without processing the event as normal.
